# ðŸ—¡ arzhur

`arzhur` is a simple program that implements a interactive filter for the editing, execution, and piping of arbitrary text.

## Selection filter

`arzhur` can receive text from either stdin or supplied arguments and will treat each argument or each line of input as a separate "window". Each window may be edited and printed to stdout by itself or joined with the other lines.

## Window management

Windows can be selected with the `h` and `l` keys, created with `n`, and deleted (only the final window) with `d`.

## Acme-style command execution

`arzhur` implements a system for executing and piping text similar to that of `acme`. The `!` command functions as an equivalent to the middle click, executing the focused text as a command a creating a new window for its output. `<` replaces the executed text, or the contents of the marked window with output. `>` pipes the marked text, putting the output in a new window. `|` pipes and replaces at once.
